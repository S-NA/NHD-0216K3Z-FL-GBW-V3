nhdlcd An Arduino library to interface with the NHD - 0216K3Z - FL - GBW -
    V3.

    The library is implemented to use SPI as the serial interface,
    although I2C would likely be a better choice if my understanding is correct
        .By the nature of using a software emulated
        SPI(bit banging) any pins can be to communicate with the LCD.Most
    commonly(due to hardware SPI) pins 13,
    12, and11 are used.
